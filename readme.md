#Scope of Work - Tracy Fuller Designs
###Overview

The site will be an overview of the various jewelry work that I do. The site will be broken up into three navigation tabs to separate different types of work. The main and leftmost tab will be an About page. The About page will include a picture of myself, a short paragraph description on the history of my work, and my contact information. The center navigation tab will feature items from the Forge Lake Studio store. The page will include examples of various styles of jewelry using a slidedown effect to hide the items not being highlighted. The right navigation tab will feature items from the BitsMonster store. It will have the same layout as the Forge Lake Studio page but will highlight items from BitsMonster.

All pages will have a consistent title throughout that states Tracy Fuller Designs.
